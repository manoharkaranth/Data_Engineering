### Final thoughts:
_IBM Data Science Professional Certificate_ from Coursera entails 9 courses. I chose the last one which is _Applied Data Science Capstone_. If you have already worked on multiple projects and well-explosed to data science, feel free to skip first 8 courses and jump straight into the capstone. The course materials are concise yet comprehensive enough. Peer evaluation helped me in exploring the good practices adopted by other learners.<br/>
Like everything else on earth, success of a business is broadly attributed to two factors - rational factor and luck factor. Luck factor in business is often associated with geography of it; for instance, Singapore's success in entrepot trading. Personally, this is the first time that I am involved in a project where location data are majorly and fully used. These learnings have opened the doors for incorporating that 'luck factor' into the equation. I reckon this course has empowered me to provide more comprehensive and all encompassing solutions going forward.
